Fed up with the government’s “indifference” to their pleas to 
provide better civic amenities including filling potholes,
‘Citizens Group, East Bengaluru’ on Sunday launched a
‘NoDevelopmentNoTax’, a campaign to boycott paying property
tax. Last week, members of the group got together and
contributed funds to fix potholes on a 6km stretch in
Halanayakanahalli, Muneshwara Layout and Choodasandra.
